Hello, my name is Easwar, and I am from Nagercoil. I hold a Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) degree in Mechanical Engineering from Amrita College of Engineering and Technology. Although my academic background is in mechanical engineering, my passion for technology and problem-solving led me to explore the world of web development. Driven by this interest, I have gained expertise in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), with a strong emphasis on frontend development.
I have also focused on enhancing my skills in modern front-end technologies such as React and frameworks like Reframe, enabling me to create dynamic and user-friendly web applications. My diverse technical knowledge, combined with a passion for continuous learning, fuels my desire to build innovative and efficient web solutions.
